# OnePageChess
A chess board and parts of the game made to work on a usb drive

This allows setting up a game position and sharing simply by sending a link

Example. Take the html file from the repo, put it anywhere, add this query string, then open using your browser.

```
chessboard.html?b=Ra1%2CPa2%2Cpa7%2Cra8%2CPb2%2Cpb6%2Cbb7%2Cnb8%2CPc2%2Cpc7%2CPd4%2Cpd7%2CKe1%2CBe2%2Cpe6%2CQe7%2CPf2%2CNf6%2Crf8%2Ckg2%2CPg3%2CNg4%2Cpg7%2CRh1%2CPh4&g=w&p=Thomas%2CLasker&l=London%2C+1912%0A&c=White+mates+in+two+moves%0A
```

NOTE: All of the fields are editable. Simply click once and edit. When you're done editing, copy the link. You can now reuse the link to bring the board back up without needing a server anywhere.
